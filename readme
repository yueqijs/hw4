How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?

```bash
40 lines, the loop runs every 10px

```

What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?


```bash
The 1st means the loop starts at the 10th px on the x-axis. 

the 2nd means the loop stops by x-10, 

the 3rd means the loop is add 10px each time. 

```
