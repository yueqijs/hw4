PART ONE

How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?

40 lines, the loop runs every 10px

What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?

The 1st means the loop starts at the 10th px on the x-axis. 

the 2nd means the loop stops by x-10, 

the 3rd means the loop is add 10px each time. 

PART TWO

How many times does the loop body run each frame, once the x and y arrays are full?

5 times

What are two ways of increasing the spacing between rings?

By adding more value to the for (...,...,i = i + ???)

or

By adding more value to the ellipse 

  ellipse(x[i*2], y[i*2], 1 + (x.length - i*2));
  
How can you make the ellipse trail longer?

  x = x.slice(-70); // remove all but the last 50 x values
  y = y.slice(-70); // remove all but the last 50 y values

```
